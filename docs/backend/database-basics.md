# Introduction to Databases

Databases used in Web development are generally classified into relational databases and non-relational databases. Relational databases or SQL databases uses a relational data model to store data. On the other hand, non-relational databases are often known as NoSQL databases.

# SQL vs NoSQL

Other than SQL databases like (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL), there are also NoSQL databases (e.g. MongoDB, DynamoDB).
Here is an good article on [Comparing MongoDB vs PostgreSQL](https://www.mongodb.com/compare/mongodb-postgresql).

# Relational Database
Relational Database was proposed by Edgar Codd (IBM Research) in 1969. It has since become the dominant database model for applications. A language called `SQL` (Structured Query Language) was developed to work with relational databases.

Today there are many commercial `Relational Database Management System` (RDBMS) such as `Oracle`, `Microsoft SQL Server`. There are also many free, open-source RDBMS such as `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`.

# Non-relational Database
The technology to store and retrieve unstructuted data have existed in the late 1960â€™s, but the term `NoSQL` was only became popular when Carlo Strozzi first used the term to name his light weight relational database in 1998. Today the non-relational databases is very much different than NoSQL databases back then.

`MongoDB` is a popular open-source NoSQL non-relational database. It is a document-orientated database that is flexible and scalable. It is best used for large amounts of unstructured data.

# Interacting with database - Native / ORM / ODM ?

There are two common approaches for interacting with a database.
1. Native query language (eg. SQL) offers the best performance.
2. Using Object Data Model ("ODM") or an Object Relational Model ("ORM"), which allows that allow the programmers to think about the JavaScript objects (modelling vs. database semantics). The ODM libraries may not use the most efficient database queries, but allow developers and maintainers to model based on business instead.

# Modelling and Representation of Database Object

In relational databases, the data are kept in tables of rows, while document-oriented databases keep their data in collections of documents.
Thus, the modelling strategy are similar but also different in some ways.

| Relational DB | Document DB |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Table         | Collection  |
| Row           | Document    |
| Index         | Index       |
| Foreign Key   | Reference   |

In general, when designing your models, it makes sense to have separate models for every "object" or a group of related information. We need to think about the following.
- models
- fields
- relationship between them

_Unified Modelling Language_ (UML) class diagram is a tool to help us visualize the models and their associations. UML is a general purpose language to help us in modelling Object Oriented Programming concepts. It's usually independent on the database modelling.

_Entity Relationship Diagram_ (ERD or ER Diagram) is a common tool for developer to represent the entities and their relationships in a database.
