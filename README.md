## Developer Training (/thoughtworks)

This repository contains the most recent guides for thoughtworks-led developer training. The content is open for future trainers to add on to, keep updated, and improve. The intention is to have one source of developer training guides to be continuously iterated upon.

**Changes made to this repository will automatically be updated in the guides that the trainees will use to supplement their learning: https://thoughtworks-sea.github.io/developer-training/#/**

Here are some older resources that are not currently maintained but may still have relevant material:
- https://thoughtworks-jumpstart.gitbook.io/book/
- https://github.com/thoughtworks-jumpstart/guides

If the trainer feels that a particular module is not relevant for the current training batch, and is better left out to avoid confusion for the trainees, they may leave it out of the guides temporarily by commenting the page out in `_sidebar.md`.
